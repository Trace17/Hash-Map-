# Hash-Map-
This repository contains two different implementations of hash maps, an open addressing method of creating a hash map labeled "hash_map_oa.py" and a seperate chaining method of creating a hash map labeled "hash_map_sc.py", as well as a folder containing a dynamic array and linked list data structure used in the implementation labeled "a6_include.py".

## How to use
To use these hash maps, download the three files "hash_map_oa.py","a6_include.py","hash_map_sc.py" and create a hashmap using "HashMap(40, hash_function_1)" where 40 is the length of the hash map and the hash function is either hash_function_1 or hash_function_2 which map the data to the hash function in different ways. There are test cases present for each function included in the files.
